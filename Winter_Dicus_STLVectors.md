## Intro

<p>STL Vectors are one of the most used functions in C++; you're more likely familiarized with how to introduce it into your code, being ``#include <vector>``. Vectors are used in cases where the developer expects to need a data structure that can expand and shrink as data is added or removed from the structure. Standard arrays aren't flexible enough to pull this off, so developers use vectors instead.</p>
